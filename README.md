# Rules/Mechanics
## Final
- Could be text, images, video, audio
- Underlying format is always call-response
- Tagging system (multiple tags)
- Search (by author, tags, content)
- Have the sequence be chronological
- Could post about:
  - Poems
  - Philosophy things
  - Books
  - General culture things (brands, designs, objects)
  - Reviews (of cultural things)
  - Mixes?
  - Diagrams
  - Maps lol
- Some things we created, some things we find in the world
- No overly intellectual language without explaining it
- Needs to be oriented toward consumption, not jacking off
- Footnotes/external sources?
- Editing posts after the fact is forbidden
- Pseudonyms
- We need some structure (no excuses) (maybe we need a reward and punishment system)
  - Posting timeline: Post a new thread every two weeks, but post a reply every week
  - Replies should be limited in length? Don't do that thing where your replies are 6 hours of reading.
  - Anything that goes over a 5-minute read should be forked into its own thread and punished by death.
- Must be accessible
- Come up with a clever way to share posts elsewhere (like twitter and instagram)

## Potential
- Flowchart/diagramattic vizualization of each conversation?
- Threaded replies (maybe with character limit)
- "Wha?"
- Mixup Mode?
- **Mediating post -> how do we go from one post to another? A traversal! Then it becomes a web of posts where everything is connected.**
- Clippings? Collections? (PDF mode?)
