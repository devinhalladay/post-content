  <p>This one's a little long, sorry. Last week I was thinking about the now-normalized concept of "influencers" on social media. I could draw all kinds of comparisons to capitalist barons and preachers (in Nietzsche's canon). But at the time, I was also trying to understand commodity fetishism and (availability bias etc) my thoughts began to filter through that lens.</p>

  <hr/>

  <p>I was seeing "influencer culture" (i.e. the cultural norms arising from interacting with influencers) as a form of commodity fetishism, where the commodity is a dream — the unattainable subjective ("projected" or, as I steal from Marx often, <em>"as through a camera obscura"</em>) reality of the influencer; an "other" reality (i.e. an <em>ideology</em>).</p>

  <p>This culture hinges on social dynamics which are not <em>specifically</em> tied to social class, but appear to inherit the apparatuses of social class broadly speaking by way of aesthetics and objects — significations — used as narrative and effect in the influencer's media presence. Examples of this that come to mind immediately are paid or undisclosed product ads; virtue or status signaling via room decoration, makeup, storytelling, etc.</p>

  <p>Influencers occupy a weird social status: "anyone" can "be an influencer" considering the relative accessibility of tools and avenues for influence (the most salient example is something like YouTube or Twitter). In reality, however, this is a gated "profession" like any other. It uses capital accumulation (even, sometimes, <em>simulated</em> accumulation, as is noticeable through a quick analysis of signs in a particular piece of influencer-produced media — let's call the thing we'd be analyzing "pure aesthetic treatments") in order to signify class division or elevation, which limits the potential of an everyday person to attain that signified status. Necessarily, there can be only a limited number of preachers.</p>

  <p>That curious social status is why we can have a YouTuber that's an "everyday-kind-of average-girl" (sic.) or a Sensitive But Kinda Masculine Dude who is clearly more well-off and privileged (or dumb-lucky) than the average viewer. This causes an accelerated form of commodity fetishism where a subjective reality is in itself commodified and fetishized through the lens of its apparent ability to be transformed into "influencer" status through the social signification of the bourgeois.</p>

  <p>The aesthetic apparatuses of this signaling turn out to be the typical ones we find throughout history — beauty, social/friend groups, posessions, views/followers/visibility, apparent wealth, even personality type (eg. up-beat vs. quiet). So maybe influencer culture is just the new age of lifestyle fetishism.</p>

  <p>Maybe I haven't explained myself very well, but I guess the conversation I'd like this to open up has its starting point as: what kinds of "fetishism" (loosely defined) emerge from late-capitalist (i.e. where unexpected things turn out to be commodities) social signification, and how do these relate to or differ from commodity fetishism in its original sense?</p>
