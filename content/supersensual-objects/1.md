we are repeating the past (i.e. dialectics), and we are still merely projecting ideology onto the world by inscribing the future in code.

<div class="sheet__response">
  <p>Augmented and virtual reality devices and the images they generate would seem to constitute the beginnings of a new class of cultural artifacts enabled by the interleaving of natural and artificial systems into a synthesized whole. In other words, these technologies may seem to introduce a new class of image into culture — a type of image that is not unlike that produced by the camera obscura. I say this for two reasons: to reveal the repetition of a dialectic embedded in the concept of technology, and to point out again the degree to which our *technologies* are projections of our ideologies.</p>

  <p> there exists a class of technological devices that operate digitally but defy normative notions or classifications of digitality. Devices that integrate deeply with reality via sensor data — devices like smart watches, home weather stations, Arduino sensors, biometric scanners — are able access *the real* (i.e. reality beyond subjectivity) in a way other devices are not.</p>

  <p>Websites and other digital artifacts often have access to real-world data through APIs that read from databases, which mediate between the interface and the world. The data served by these APIs is real-world data, but it is only a *representation* of the real itself. Obviosuly a weather app cannot access the weather itself — not in the same way that I can go outside in the pouring rain and get soaked to the bone. The physiology of data is not sensory.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the class of devices that integrate more deeply with reality ("the internet of things") </p>

  What these technologies do is recontextualize data in a way that is analogous to the init from our physical senses, and augments it.
