  <p>It seems to me that AR and VR constitute a new class of cultural artifacts beyond the digital. Put another way, AR and VR are not digital — at least not purely. They are hybrid objects, objects that are a synthesis of natural and artificial systems (which includes digital systems).</p>

  <p>Beyond just AR and VR, which we are all tired of hearing about, there is a class of technological devices that operate digitally but transcend traditional notions or classifications of digitality. These devices, like smart watches, home weather stations, and Arduino sensors, are able to do something that traditional digital applications and services are not: access the real.</p>

  <p>Digital things — let's focus on websites and webapps for now — have access to real-world data through APIs and databases, which mediate between the interface and the real world. The data served by APIs and databases is real-world data, but it is only a representation of the real. APIs and databases are derived artifacts: they contain data that is derived, through various arbitrary levels of mediation, from the real. Their immediate spritual or metaphysical connection to the real is severed. Take, as a cheap example, an iOS weather app, which designers love to keep reinventing. A weather app can access data about the weather, but only through several layers of mediation that distort and alter the meaning of that data. A weather app ca21nnot access the weather itself — not in the same way that I can go outside in the pouring rain and get soaked to the bone. Data does not have a physiology.</p>

  <p>This new class of devices, on the other hand — these </p>

  I think AR and VR constitute a new class of devices beyond the digital. Digtial things have access to real-world data, but only to representations of it — APIs contain data that derived from the real thing. Like a weather app can access data about the weather but it cannot access the weather itself. It's like Plato's metaphysical dualism. But sensor-enabled devices are ale to access the real thing.

  What these technologies do is recontextualize data in a way that is analogous to the init from our physical senses, and augments it.
