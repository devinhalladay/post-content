        The sacrifice of agency in exchange for comfort and security is a dominant human social interaction that may as well be intrinsic to the normative notion of exchange. Peeking your head into any given historical period will show you a picture not unlike those drunk photos from that weird party that one night a while back: you'll see people of all social roles and classes dazed and out of their minds, shotgunning whatever ideology happens to ease their suffering the most. The "opiates of the masses" are as plural as the masses themselves. Anyways, as T implies, our incarceration system doubles as a basic social safety net, which is dangerous but intriguing, especially through the lens of agency. A sacrifice of one's <em>vitality</em> in exchange for one's <em>survival</em>.
