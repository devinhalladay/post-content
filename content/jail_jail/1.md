<p> Recently while visiting the ICA at Philadelphia, Sophie and I came across Tony Conrad’s retrospective exhibition. The penultimate piece in the show was ‘Jail, Jail’. </p>

<br>
<p> I exclaimed when I saw it, mostly because I didn’t expect an installation of pastel jail cells in a gallery space. The guard caught my response and remarked “Yeah, people love to take ‘jail selfies’ here.” </p>

<br>
<p> She explained to me that most of the visitors at the exhibit about prison cells just come to take 'jail selfies' in the gallery. I remarked that's gross and seems like a weird glorification of the terrible incarceration system. (However, it was really to no one's surprise considering the demographics of the visitors.) She went on to comment that it gets more sinister. In Rhonda’s time serving as a prison guard she picked up that the jail really is an oddly romanticized concept, even by the inmates. Some of them feel grateful to be in jail. “Thank god you’re taking me in, it’s getting colder” — they’d remark on getting arrested. She said it helps them function — to have meals provided and a roof over their head. They seem to be conditioned to think the prison is where they belong. (I thought of Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates when she said this and was reminded of just the risk of being framed/incarcerated or being a victim to police brutality informs the lived experience of Black people in America.) </p>

<br>
<p> Rhonda went in to say that she’s heard inmates be 'thankful' for the structure that it gives to them. This was followed up by a short silence. I think at that moment we collectively wondered (and lamented) about things turned out to be this way. All things considered, it seems society encourages giving up agency for a sense of 'comfort', especially to the already disenfranchised. </p>
