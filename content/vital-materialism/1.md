<p>Models and representations block, to some degree, our access to embodied, vital, material reality. They interfere with and in some cases sever intrinsic connections between embodied experience and the vital material world. Over time, models and representations that are used frequently or authoritatively enough begin to sublimate into the base reality — we begin to view the <em>model</em> as a source of truth, giving it precedence over empirical experience in our ontological and epistemological standings. This is an emergent and cyclical phenomenon brought about by social life in a technical society organized around notions of truth and science. I should note my use here of the word "technical" instead of "technological" — it's not <em>technology</em> that causes this emergence, but rather the pathological social drive toward a technical understanding of the configuration of the world.</p>

<p>Today, models and representational systems are pervasive. This means that our relationship to the world around us has been fundamentally altered to be more technical. The earth has been transformed into a technical object. Our faithful belief in the truthiness of systems and models has led to almost total immersion in technical models and representational systems. These systems and models help us better understand and control the world we find ourselves thrown into, but they also sever our connection to the real objects and systems that are being modeled and represented. This is because we internalize these models as time proves them to be accurate: the more a model correctly predicts and fits the reality we see before us, the more we trust and internalize its predictions. Letting models and representational systems be our interface with the world forces us to sacrifice some of our agency. Like ideology, models and representations constrict our experience of reality. They augment our field of activity, but limit the mobility of our intellect.</p>

<p>A direct consequence of pervasive and relentless modeling and representation is that the social world has failed to develop and internalize the idea of vital materialism. Vital materialism, written about with great force by the brilliant Jane Bennett, is the belief that matter has a certain vitality and life to it, and that this quality of vitality imbues all matter with agency. Vitality is derived from being a contributing part of a dynamic system that enables the emergence and entropic decay of its parts. Viewing the world through this lens makes one more aware of their embodied situation within a dynamic and vital system. By increasing one's awareness and acknowledging the agency of material, we may develop dynamic ontologies that assume and defend the agency of all matter and non-matter. Eventually, we will be left with a world built upon ideas of universal equality and intrinsic agency, leading to alternative political, social, and economic realities.</p>
